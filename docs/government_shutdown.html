<title>End Government Shutdowns</title>
</head>

<h1>Government Shutdowns</h1>
  <p>
    When the US Congress shuts down the government the disruptions ripple through the economy at home and abroad.  But other than an increase in phone calls, emails, and tweets directed at them, the members of Congress are mostly insulated from the pain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before proposing a solution, let us consider two other needs that can be solved at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    During COVID in 2020 Congress had to shut the main building, but did not have a robust and prepared Plan B.  During the Cold War an offsite location existed under the Greenbrier Hotel in West Virginia, but that is now a museum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each year the political parties have an offsite retreat for all their members of the House and Senate to gather and plan.  Usually this is at a larger hotel somewhere, often with golf available.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a plan to solve all three of these issues at once.
  </p>


<h2>Offsite Congressional Locations</h2>
  <p>
    To allow Congress to have a place to go that is not in the center of Washington, DC there should be three or four sites that combined can hold all of the House and Senate, along with sufficient staff to function.  There should also be room for the senior leadership of the Executive Branch and their needed staff.
  </p>
  <p>
   These sites should be located such that each is less than an eight hour drive from Washington, DC, and they should be spread out geographically so if something happens to one, the others can continue to function.  If possible, they should be large enough that one site can be left empty during use.  If you flee DC to avoid a hurricane, no point staying somewhere else in the storm’s path. 
  </p>
  <p>
    At least one of the facilities should be large enough to allow the full party retreat, though they may have to do with less staff to get everyone to fit. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Cold War is over so the sites don’t need to be buried to resist a nuclear strike.  But they should still provide options to keep the government going during an emergency. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The facilities should be thoroughly connected with each other and other government facilities for secure communication.  Each member should be provided with a location so they can join online calls and meetings using the secure internal system.  Additionally they should have separate connections so they can connect with the press for interviews. 
  </p>
  <p>
    C-SPAN should maintain a presence to be ready broadcast the proceedings. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When members of Congress speak with donors over the phone they are not allowed to do so from their government offices or phones.  They often travel a few blocks away to their other office maintained by the political parties.  As that won’t be practical at the off site locations, each member will have multiple phone lines available to them.  Their phone numbers from their offices in the home district, the office in DC, and their party provided lines should be routed here.  The other rules about separation of fundraising still apply, but the need to go to another building can be waived while at the offsite facility. 
  </p>


<h2>Regular usage</h2>
  <p>
    The facilities should be maintained so with just a few days notice, they are ready to receive their residents and function as the temporary home of government.  In the event of a pandemic, hurricane, blizzard, or any other reason when it would be a good idea to not have the government in Washington, DC, the sites should activate to let government continue function. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The members should be sorted  between the facilities so some of each committee or executive department are at each site for proper redundancy should one facility become compromised. 
  </p>


<h2>Annual usage for a test week</h2>
  <p>
    A back up plan that is never tested is not a plan. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To make sure everyone knows how things work, at least once each year the government shall move into the remote facilities for a week.  Congress begins their session in January, thus sometime in the spring would be a good time to do it.  New members get a chance to try out the facility early in their term, and it is a chance for some team building exercises. 
  </p>
  <p>
    During the test week in addition to Congress, the President, Vice President and the cabinet level members of the Executive Branch shall be spread among the offsite locations. 
  </p>


<h2>Party retreats</h2>
  <p>
    The largest of the facilities shall be made available to each political party twice a year so they can have their regularly planned retreats.  The retreats should be more efficient with proper facilities that would not be available in a regular hotel. 
  </p>


<h2>Alternative uses</h2>
  <p>
    The facility will be sitting idle much of the year without Congress in residence.  To fill the gap, these sites should be used as conference centers for government agencies.  In the event the facilities are needed for their primary purpose of being the seat of government, it is much easier to displace a government agency than paying clients trying to have a more public conference. 
  </p>


<h2>Government shutdowns</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we have set up remote facilities for Congress it is time to turn the real problem, government shut downs. 
  </p>


<h3>Current plan</h3>
  <p>
    The two most common triggers of a shutdown are hitting the debt ceiling or not having a valid budget.  In either case the following usually happens:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-essential portions of the government shut down and employees stop getting paid, even departments that are revenue positive and bring money in</li>
    <li>Some essential portions of the government stay open, and the employees may or may not get paid</li>
    <li>Financial markets become volatile</li>
    <li>Government services are disrupted which has ripple affects through the whole economy</li>
    <li>After a deal is reached, employees may or may not get paid for the time they were idled</li>
    <li>Members of Congress continue to get paid</li>
  </ul>


<h3>Proposed plan</h3>
  <p>
    A properly functioning Congress should never reach this step, but since they seem to do it regularly, it is time to provide an incentive to sort things out as early as possible. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day – 7</h4>
  <p>
    Offsite locations notified to be ready to open.  Assigned locations confirmed for each participant to account for any changes since the last use of the facilities. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day – 3</h4>
  <p>
    Participants arrive at their designated offsite location.  There are still three days before the shutdown to reach a deal. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The President and Vice President each participate in the offsite gathering.  One may be needed for the tie breaking vote, and the other will be needed to sign the resulting bill. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Cabinet members are exempt from being offsite as they should be busy working with their departments to support the debate and be ready to implement the results. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day</h4>
  <p>
    An automatic clean continuing resolution will take effect to keep all branches of the government open at currently budgeted spending levels.  New projects about to break ground may be delayed if there is a chance they won’t be funded, but all regular government activity continues as normal.  Hiring may be delayed, but no layoffs during the uncertainty. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It is tempting to put congressional pay on hold here.  But as most members are wealthy, this is not a threat to them.  The few members where this is a problem would be vulnerable to pressure not applied to their colleagues, so no changes to their pay. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The ability to use the fundraising phone lines is removed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The ability to leave the facility is removed.  Members of Congress and the Senate along with the President and Vice President are now grounded until a budget exists. 
  </p>
  <p>
    No days off.  Congress will meet every day until a budget exists.  Half days when appropriate to allow religious observances. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day + 2</h4>
  <p>
    Meals change to a menu in line a state supported university cafeteria. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day + 4 </h4>
  <p>
    The dress code changes to jumpsuits.  Perhaps prison orange. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day + 6></h4>
  <p>
    Meals change to a menu in line with a public middle school cafeteria. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day + 9</h4>
  <p>
    Meals change to a menu in line with what World Central Kitchen is able to provide in a disaster zone. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day + 12</h4>
  <p>
    Meals change to MREs. 
  </p>


<h4>Shutdown day + 14</h4>
  <p>
    Each side picks 10 negotiators to finish the deal.  The 20 of them go into a conference room with a large table and chairs, 4 cots, a pile of MREs, and a bathroom for each team.  Both sides must have 8 of 10 seated at the table and awake at all times.  If either side fails to keep active, the other side wins the point being discussed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    No one leaves the room until a deal is reached. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the event of a medical emergency, a replacement team member can take their place.  However, the other team can swap out one member at the same time to maintain a balanced amount of freshness. 
  </p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Government shutdowns are disruptive to the economy and should be avoided.  If there is pain to be had during the negotiations, it should be felt by those with the power to make a decision. 
  </p>
  <p>
    An automatic clean continuing resolution will keep government open. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Should there be another pandemic or disaster, the government can function more normally from secure locations outside the capital. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Annual party retreats can be held at facilities with secure communications. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Government agencies have new options for meetings by using the facilities when Congress is not using them.
